webhook executes a program whenever it receives a webhook request
from Github.  The child program is run with repository information
set in its environment, and with the json commit data written to
its standard input. webhook guarantees that only one child program
is run at a time.

BUILD:

	$ go build -o webhook

RUNNING:

The best way to run webhook is under a supervisor. Any one will do,
choose whatever you already have installed. Some popular supervisors
are

	- runit
	- daemontools
	- supervisord
	- upstart (part of Ubuntu and RHEL 6 base install)
	- systemd (ugh)
	- s6

Provided in this repository are example files to run webhook under
upstart and daemontools.
